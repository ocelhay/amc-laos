AMC monitoring is being conducted in Lao PDR at both national and hospital levels. This AMC dashboard contains National AMC data and surveillance data from three provincial hospitals, including Salavan, Xienghuang and Luang Namtha Provincial Hospitals. In the future, more AMC data from other surveillance sites in Laos will also be uploaded.
