The 2019 WHO AWaRe Classification Database was developed on the recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.  Antibiotics are classified as Access, Watch or Reserve based on their pharmacological class, ATC codes and WHO Essential Medicines List status. Access group antibiotics have activity against a wide range of commonly encountered susceptible pathogens while also showing lower resistance potential than antibiotics in other groups. Watch antibiotics have higher resistance potential and includes most of the highest priority agents among the Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and/or antibiotics that are at relatively high risk of selection of bacterial resistance. Reserve antibiotics should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms. WHO has set a goal for 60% of all antibiotics consumed to come from the Access group by 2023.
