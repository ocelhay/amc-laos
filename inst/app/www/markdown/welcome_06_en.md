The most commonly used measure for reporting of drug utilization is numbers of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) where the DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults e.g. the DDD for amoxicillin is 1,500 mg (equivalent to a standard dose of 500 mg 3 times a day). A DDD is only assigned for drugs that already have an anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) code. Converting aggregate quantities of medicines to DDDs allows a rough estimation of the potential treatment days of the pharmaceutical procured or consumed. The DDD, however, is only a technical unit of use and does not necessarily reflect the recommended or average prescribed dose.
The updated DDD values released by the WHO International Working Group for Drug Statistics Methodology in 2019 have been adopted and used to analyse all available data in order to avoid inconsistencies in estimates of total antibiotic consumption, relative use of antibiotic classes and interpretation of national and international comparisons over time.
